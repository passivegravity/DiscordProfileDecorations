If you want to change the decoration that you're currently using head over to the **script source code edit** either in your extensions
or any other text application, even Notepad.



To change your profile decoration head over to "Source Links" below the main code and chose one of your liking.

After you've done so copy the given link and head over to 28th line of code that contains this:

```css
background: url("https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatar-decoration-presets/v2_a_683904e98e8e7bca912125d360293cc6.png?size=160&passthrough=true") center/cover;
```

Simply delete the link that is in **"quotes"** and replace it with yours - like in the example given below:

```css
background: url("My Decoration Link") center/cover;
```
